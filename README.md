## Project Overview

CapSure is an intelligent computer vision system that uses deep learning, OCR, and image retrieval techniques to identify pills from a live camera feed or uploaded image. Simply point your phone or webcam at a pill — and CapSure will detect it, read its imprint, and identify what medication it is with high confidence.
